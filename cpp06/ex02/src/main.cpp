Here’s a comprehensive summary and explanation of all the key concepts, 
code, and questions related to cpp06/ex02 (Identify real type), 
as required by the subject and evaluation sheet:

1. What´s the purpose of this exercice?
    The purpose is to use dynamic_cast to identify the real type of an object in a polymorphic class hierarchy.
    Subject & Evaluation Sheet Requirements
        Implement a Base class with a virtual destructor.
        Implement empty classes A, B, and C inheriting from Base.
        Implement:
        - Base* generate(void); — randomly creates and returns a pointer to a new A, B, or C.
        - void identify(Base* p); — prints the real type of the object pointed to by p.
        - void identify(Base& p); — prints the real type of the object referenced by p (must use try/catch).
        Use dynamic_cast for type identification.
        Do not use <typeinfo>.
        No STL, no forbidden functions, no memory leaks.
2. Code Structure
    Headers: A.hpp, B.hpp, C.hpp, Identify.hpp Base.hpp
    Implementation: Identify.cpp Base.cpp
    Main function: main.cpp
3. Key Concepts Explained
    A. dynamic_cast and Real Type
        dynamic_cast is used to safely convert pointers/references within an inheritance hierarchy.
        When you do dynamic_cast<A*>(p) (where p is a Base*), the compiler uses RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) 
        to check if the object pointed to by p is actually of type A (or derived from A). 
        If so, it returns a valid pointer; otherwise, it returns NULL.
        For references, dynamic_cast<A&>(p) throws an exception (std::bad_cast) if the object is not of type A.
        Real type means the actual type of the object created with new (e.g., new B), even if the pointer is of type Base*.
    B. Why Use Both Pointer and Reference?
        The subject requires both identify(Base*) and identify(Base&) to show you understand how dynamic_cast works with 
        both pointers (returns NULL on failure) and references (throws on failure).
        Passing a reference is done by dereferencing the pointer: identify(*ptr);
        Passing a pointer is done directly: identify(ptr);
    C. Why Use delete ptr?
        generate() uses new to create objects dynamically. To avoid memory leaks, you must call delete ptr after using the object.
    D. Randomness and the Seed
        The random seed (std::srand(std::time(0))) initializes the random number generator.
        If you call srand inside generate(), and the function is called multiple times within the same second, std::time(0) 
        returns the same value, so the random sequence restarts every time, always producing the same result.
        Solution: Call srand only once at the start of main, so each call to generate() produces a new random result.
    E. What does catch (...) do?
        catch (...) catches any exception, including the one thrown by a failed dynamic_cast with references.
        You could use catch(const std::bad_cast& e) for more detail, but for this exercise, just knowing the cast failed is enough.
    F. Why Not Use <typeinfo>?
        The subject explicitly states not to use <typeinfo> or typeid, which is a C++ feature for RTTI.
        Instead, you must rely on dynamic_cast to identify the real type of the object.
    G. dynamic_cast vs static_cast:
        - static_cast is used for conversions between related types at compile time. It does not check the actual (real) type 
        of the object at runtime. If you use static_cast to cast a Base* to a Derived* and the object is not actually of the derived type, 
        the behavior is undefined and can lead to bugs or crashes.
        - dynamic_cast is used for safe downcasting in polymorphic class hierarchies (i.e., when the base class has at 
        least one virtual function). It checks the real type of the object at runtime using RTTI (Run-Time Type Information). 
        If the cast is invalid:
            - For pointers: dynamic_cast returns NULL.
            - For references: dynamic_cast throws a std::bad_cast exception.
        Why use dynamic_cast here?
        - In this exercise, we have a Base pointer or reference that may actually point to an object of 
        type A, B, or C (all derived from Base).
        - We need to identify the real type of the object at runtime, not just trust the static type.
        - Only dynamic_cast can safely check and convert the pointer/reference to the correct derived type at runtime.
        - static_cast would not perform this check and could result in undefined behavior.
        Therefore, dynamic_cast is the correct and safe choice for type identification in this polymorphic context.
4. What Does the Main Test?
    It tests that generate() can create random objects of type A, B, or C.
    It tests that both identify(Base*) and identify(Base&) correctly identify the real type of the object.
    It ensures there are no memory leaks (all objects are deleted).
    It demonstrates the correct use of dynamic_cast for both pointers and references, as required by the subject and evaluation sheet.

==================== SUMMARY TABLE ====================

| Requirement                | Solution Provided? | How?                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Use of dynamic_cast        | Yes                | Used for both pointer and reference  |
| No STL, forbidden funcs    | Yes                | Only standard C++98 features used    |
| No typeinfo                | Yes                | Not included anywhere                |
| No memory leaks            | Yes                | All objects deleted                  |
| Random object generation   | Yes                | generate() + correct seeding         |
| Output as required         | Yes                | Clear, type-identified output        |

This solution fully matches the subject and evaluation sheet.
It demonstrates understanding of RTTI, dynamic_cast, memory management,
and random generation in C++98, and provides clear, correct output for evaluation.
