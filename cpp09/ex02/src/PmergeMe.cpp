1. What is the Ford-Johnson Algorithm? What is the Jacobsthal Sequence? What are they useful for? What is the difference?
    - Ford-Johnson Algorithm (Merge-Insertion Sort):
        . The Ford-Johnson algorithm is a sorting algorithm designed to sort a list of numbers using the minimum possible number of comparisons.
        . It works by:
            1. Pairing up elements and sorting each pair.
            2. Recursively sorting the larger elements from each pair (called "majors").
            3. Inserting the smaller elements ("minors") into the sorted list of majors in a special order (not just left-to-right), to minimize comparisons.
        . Usefulness: It is theoretically optimal for small lists and is studied for its efficiency in comparison count, though not commonly used in practice for large datasets.
        . Example: Suppose you want to sort [7, 2, 5, 3, 8]:
            - Pair up: (7,2), (5,3), (8) (straggler)
            - Sort pairs: (7,2) → (7,2), (5,3) → (5,3)
            - Majors: [7,5], Minors: [2,3], Straggler: 8
            - Sort majors: [5,7]
            - Insert minors [2,3] into [5,7] using Jacobsthal order (see below)
            - Insert straggler 8 at the end.
    - Jacobsthal Sequence:
        . The Jacobsthal sequence is a mathematical sequence: 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, ...
        . Defined by: J(0)=0, J(1)=1, J(n)=J(n-1)+2*J(n-2)
        . Usefulness in Ford-Johnson: The sequence is used to determine the optimal order in which to insert the minors into the sorted majors, minimizing the number of comparisons.
        . Example: For 4 minors, Jacobsthal up to 4: 0, 1, 3, 5
            - Insertion order: 1, 4, 3, 2 (based on the code's logic)
    Difference:
    . Ford-Johnson is a sorting algorithm (a method for sorting numbers).
    . Jacobsthal is just a sequence of numbers (a mathematical tool).
    . In the Ford-Johnson algorithm, the Jacobsthal sequence is used as a helper to decide the best order for inserting elements.
    Example:
        . Ford-Johnson: "How do I sort this list with the fewest comparisons?"
        . Jacobsthal: "Here’s a sequence (0,1,3,5,...) that tells you the best order to insert elements for that goal."
    How They Are Used in Your Code
        - Jacobsthal in my code:
            . generateJacobsthal(int n) creates the sequence up to n.
            . generateInsertionOrder(int n) uses the Jacobsthal sequence to create the order in which minors are inserted into the sorted majors.
        - Ford-Johnson in my code:
            . sortVector and sortDeque implement the Ford-Johnson algorithm:
                - Pair up elements, sort each pair.
                - Separate majors and minors.
                - Recursively sort majors.
                - Insert minors into the sorted majors using the order from generateInsertionOrder (which is based on Jacobsthal).
                - If there’s a straggler (odd number of elements), insert it at the end.
        - Practical Example with Your Code: Suppose v = [4, 1, 3, 2, 5]
            . Pairs: (4,1), (3,2), (5) (straggler)
            . Sorted pairs: (4,1), (3,2)
            . Majors: [4,3], Minors: [1,2], Straggler: 5
            . Sort majors: [3,4]
            . Insert minors [1,2] into [3,4] using Jacobsthal-based order (from generateInsertionOrder)
            . Insert straggler 5 at the end.
            
    ==================== Summary Table ====================

    | Concept      | What is it?         | In your code?                          | Example use in your code                |
    |--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | Ford-Johnson | Sorting algorithm   | sortVector, sortDeque                  | The whole sorting process               |
    | Jacobsthal   | Math sequence       | generateJacobsthal, generateInsertionOrder | Decides insertion order for minors  |

    =======================================================

2. Why use vector and deque and not other containers? What is the difference, and why are these two the best choices?
    - Why vector and deque?
        . Both std::vector and std::deque are sequence containers in C++ that store elements in a linear order and allow fast random access.
        . The Ford-Johnson algorithm requires:
            - Fast access to elements by index (for pairing, sorting, and inserting).
            - Efficient insertion at arbitrary positions (for inserting minors).
        . vector is the most common container for dynamic arrays, providing fast access and efficient memory usage.
        . deque (double-ended queue) allows fast insertions/removals at both ends, and also provides random access.
    - Why not other containers?
        . std::list: Linked lists allow fast insertions/removals anywhere, but do not provide fast random access (accessing the nth element is slow).
        . std::set/std::map: These are sorted associative containers, but they do not allow duplicate elements and do not provide direct access by index.
        . std::array: Fixed size, not suitable for dynamic input.
    - Best Choices:
        .vector and deque are best because they combine fast random access (needed for pairing and sorting) with reasonable insertion performance for the sizes used in this algorithm.
3. Differences between vector and deque, and their time complexities
    std::vector:
        . Stores elements in a single contiguous block of memory.
        . Fastest random access (O(1) time).
        . Inserting/removing at the end is fast (amortized O(1)), but inserting/removing at the beginning or middle is slow (O(n)), because elements must be shifted.
        . Memory is compact and cache-friendly.
    - std::deque:
        . Stores elements in multiple blocks (not contiguous).
        . Random access is still O(1), but slightly slower than vector due to non-contiguous memory.
        . Fast insertions/removals at both the front and back (O(1)), but inserting/removing in the middle is O(n).
        . Slightly more memory overhead than vector.
    - Time Complexity Comparison:

==================== Time Complexity Comparison ====================

| Operation         | vector              | deque                   |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Access [i]        | O(1) (fastest)      | O(1) (slightly slower)  |
| Insert at end     | O(1) amortized      | O(1)                    |
| Insert at front   | O(n)                | O(1)                    |
| Insert in middle  | O(n)                | O(n)                    |
| Remove at end     | O(1)                | O(1)                    |
| Remove at front   | O(n)                | O(1)                    |

====================================================================
    - Summary:
        . Use vector when you mostly add/remove at the end and need the fastest access.
        . Use deque if you need to add/remove at both ends efficiently.
        . For Ford-Johnson, both are suitable because the algorithm mostly needs fast access and reasonable insertion performance.

4 - Detailed explantion
        Here is a detailed, 
        step-by-step simulation of the Ford-Johnson (Merge-Insertion) 
        sorting process (including Jacobsthal for minors) for the input [2, 7, 5, 3, 8] as implemented in my PmergeMe.cpp:
            1. Initial Input: 
                    Input: [2, 7, 5, 3, 8]
                    . Size is 5 (odd), so the last element (8) is the "straggler" and is set aside.
                    . Remaining: [2, 7, 5, 3]
            2. Pairing and Identifying Majors/Minors
                Pairs (by consecutive elements):
                    . Pair 1: (2, 7) → major: 7, minor: 2
                    . Pair 2: (5, 3) → major: 5, minor: 3
                So:
                    . Majors: [7, 5]
                    . Minors: [2, 3]
            3. Sort Pairs by Major
                Sort pairs by major (ascending):
                    . (5, 3), (7, 2)
                So after sorting:
                    . Majors: [5, 7]
                    . Minors: [3, 2]
            4. Recursively Sort Majors
                Majors: [5, 7] (already sorted, as only two elements)
            5. Build Main Chain
                Main chain starts as the sorted majors:
                    mainChain = [5, 7]
            6. Generate Jacobsthal-based Insertion Order for Minors
                Number of minors: 2
                    . Jacobsthal sequence up to 2: [0, 1, 1]
                    . Insertion order (from generateInsertionOrder): [1, 2]
                        - But since minors are indexed from 0, and size is 2, the actual order is [1, 0] (see NOTE BELLOW).
                So, minors = [3, 2], insertion order = [1, 0]:
                    . Insert minor at index 1 (which is 2) first
                    . Then minor at index 0 (which is 3)
            7. Insert Minors into Main Chain
                a. Insert minor at index 1 (value 2):
                    . mainChain = [5, 7]
                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 2:
                        - 2 < 5, so insert at position 0
                    . Result: [2, 5, 7]
                b. Insert minor at index 0 (value 3):
                    . mainChain = [2, 5, 7]
                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 3:
                        - 3 > 2, 3 < 5, so insert at position 1
                    . Result: [2, 3, 5, 7]
                NOTE: No matter the order of minors ([2, 3] or [3, 2]), the final mainChain is always [2, 3, 5, 7].
                    This is because each minor is inserted into its correct sorted position using std::lower_bound, not just appended.
                        . Case 1: minors = [2, 3]
                            - Initial mainChain: [5, 7]
                            - Insertion order (Jacobsthal): [1, 0]
                                1. Insert minors[1] (which is 3):
                                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 3 in [5, 7].
                                    . 3 < 5, so insert at position 0.
                                    . mainChain becomes: [3, 5, 7]
                                2. Insert minors[0] (which is 2):
                                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 2 in [3, 5, 7].
                                    . 2 < 3, so insert at position 0.
                                    . mainChain becomes: [2, 3, 5, 7]
                        . Case 2: minors = [3, 2]
                            - Initial mainChain: [5, 7]
                            - Insertion order (Jacobsthal): [1, 0]
                                1. Insert minors[1] (which is 2):
                                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 2 in [5, 7].
                                    . 2 < 5, so insert at position 0.
                                    . mainChain becomes: [2, 5, 7]
                                2. Insert minors[0] (which is 3):
                                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 3 in [2, 5, 7].
                                    . 3 > 2, 3 < 5, so insert at position 1.
                                    . mainChain becomes: [2, 3, 5, 7]
            8. Insert Straggler
                Straggler: 8
                    . mainChain = [2, 3, 5, 7]
                    . Use std::lower_bound to find where to insert 8:
                        - 8 > 7, so insert at the end
                    . Result: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]
                Summary Table for [2, 7, 5, 3, 8]

                | Step      | mainChain         | Action                  | Inserted Value   |
                |-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
                | Start     | [5, 7]            | -                       | -                |
                | Insert 2  | [2, 5, 7]         | Insert minor[1] (2)     | 2                |
                | Insert 3  | [2, 3, 5, 7]      | Insert minor[0] (3)     | 3                |
                | Insert 8  | [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]   | Insert straggler (8)    | 8                |

            9. Final Sorted Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]

            Key Points in the Code
                . Pairing: Always pair consecutive elements, major is the larger, minor is the smaller.
                . Majors: Sorted recursively, form the initial main chain.
                . Minors: Inserted into the main chain in a specific order determined by the Jacobsthal sequence (to minimize comparisons).
                . Insertion Order: Starts at index 1 (the second minor), then follows the Jacobsthal grouping, then any leftovers.
                . Straggler: If the input size is odd, the last element is inserted at the end.
            Why the Insertion Order Starts at Index 1
                . The Ford-Johnson algorithm proves that inserting the second minor first (index 1) minimizes the number of comparisons.
                . The code does this with order.push_back(1); in generateInsertionOrder.
            - Fallback Loop
                . After the Jacobsthal-based order, the code checks for any minors not yet inserted and inserts them (important for larger lists).



            ###############################################################################
            NOTE: Regarding point 6.Generate Jacobsthal-based Insertion Order for Minors
            AND - But since minors are indexed from 0, and size is 2, the actual order is [1, 0] (see NOTE BELLOW):

                Let's clarify in detail how the insertion order from generateInsertionOrder ([1, 2]) 
                relates to the actual indices used for inserting minors ([1, 0]) in your code, especially when n = 2.
                1. What does generateInsertionOrder(2) return?
                    . The function returns [1, 2] for n = 2.
                    . This is based on the Jacobsthal sequence and the Ford-Johnson algorithm's optimal insertion order.
                2. What are the valid indices for minors?
                    . If you have 2 minors, their indices are 0 and 1 (since C++ uses 0-based indexing).
                    . So, minors[0] and minors[1] are the only valid elements.
                3. How is the insertion order used in the code?
                    In my code: 
                            for (size_t k = 0; k < jacobOrder.size(); ++k) 
                            {
                                int idx = jacobOrder[k];
                                if (idx < (int)minors.size() && !inserted[idx]) 
                                {
                                    // insert minors[idx] into mainChain
                                    // ...
                                    inserted[idx] = true;
                                }
                            }
                    . The code iterates over the generated order (jacobOrder), which is [1, 2].
                    . For each idx in this order:
                        - It checks if idx < minors.size() (i.e., idx < 2).
                        - If true, it inserts minors[idx].
                        - If false (e.g., idx == 2), it skips, because minors[2] would be out of bounds.
                4. What actually happens for n = 2?
                    . jacobOrder = [1, 2]
                    . Loop:
                        - k = 0: idx = 1 → valid, so minors[1] is inserted.
                        - k = 1: idx = 2 → not valid (2 < 2 is false), so nothing happens.
                    . After this loop, only minors[1] has been inserted.
                5. How does the code ensure all minors are inserted?
                    . After the main loop, there is a fallback loop:
                        for (size_t i = 0; i < minors.size(); ++i) 
                        {
                            if (!inserted[i]) 
                            {
                                // insert minors[i] into mainChain
                                // ...
                            }
                        }
                    . This loop checks for any minors that were not inserted (i.e., inserted[0] is still false).
                    . It then inserts minors[0].
                6. Why does the order end up as [1, 0]?
                    . The actual order of insertion is:
                        - Insert minors[1] (from the Jacobsthal order).
                        - Insert minors[0] (from the fallback loop).
                    . So, the effective insertion order is [1, 0].
                7. Why does generateInsertionOrder return [1, 2]?
                    . The Ford-Johnson algorithm, via the Jacobsthal sequence, generates an order that may include indices outside the valid range for small n.
                    . The code is robust: it only inserts minors for valid indices (idx < minors.size()).
                    . For larger n, the Jacobsthal order covers more indices, but for small n, the fallback loop ensures all minors are inserted.
                    
                ==================== Summary Table ====================

                | Step      | jacobOrder | idx | Inserted? |      Action      |
                |-----------|------------|-----|-----------|------------------|
                |    1      |   [1, 2]   |  1  |  false    |  Insert [1]      |
                |    2      |   [1, 2]   |  2  |    -      |  Skip (OOB)      |
                |    3      | fallback   |  0  |  false    |  Insert [0]      |

                =======================================================
                Key Point
                    . The insertion order from generateInsertionOrder is [1, 2], but only valid indices are used.
                    . For n = 2, this means only index 1 is used from the generated order, and index 0 is handled by the fallback loop.
                    . The actual insertion order of minors is [1, 0].

    Code explanation (generateJacobsthal, generateInsertionOrder, and sortVector):
        - The code implements the Ford-Johnson merge-insert sort algorithm using the Jacobsthal sequence to determine the insertion order of minors.
        - The generateJacobsthal function generates the Jacobsthal sequence up to a given number n, which is used to determine the insertion order of minors.
        - The generateInsertionOrder function uses the Jacobsthal sequence to create an insertion order for minors based on their indices.
        - The sortVector function sorts a vector using the Ford-Johnson algorithm, inserting minors into the main chain in the order determined by the Jacobsthal sequence.

        // Generate Jacobsthal sequence up to n
        static std::vector<int> generateJacobsthal(int n) 
        {
            std::vector<int> jacobsthal;
            jacobsthal.push_back(0); // J(0) = 0. So the first element is always 0.
            jacobsthal.push_back(1); // J(1) = 1. So the second element is always 1.
            // ... in case of [2, 7, 5, 3, 8] in which minors = [2,3], we have n = 2, so we need to generate the Jacobsthal sequence up to 2.
            // ... And how we generate the Jacobsthal sequence? We start with J(0) = 0 and J(1) = 1, and then we use the formula J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2) to generate the next elements.
            // ... for example, the next elements would be J(2) = J(1) + 2 * J(0) = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1, J(3) = J(2) + 2 * J(1) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3, and so on.
            // ... So the Jacobsthal sequence starts as [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, ...].
            // ... We continue generating the sequence until the last element is less than n.
            // ... For example, if n = 10, we would generate the sequence [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11], and then we would stop because the last element (11) is greater than n (10).
            // ... This sequence is used to determine the insertion order of minors in the main chain.
            // ... For example, if we have minors = [2, 3], we would generate the Jacobsthal sequence up to 2, which is [0, 1, 1], and then we would use this sequence to determine the insertion order of minors in the main chain.
            // ... So the insertion order would be [1, 2], meaning we would insert the minor at index 1 first, then at index 2.
            // ... how do we get [1, 2] from [0, 1, 1]? We take the last element of the Jacobsthal sequence (which is 1) and add 1 to it to get the insertion order. So we get [1, 2] from [0, 1, 1].
            // ... after this, we insert [2, 3] using the insertion order [1, 2] into the main chain, 
            // ... step by step:
            // ... 1. Insert 2 at position 1 in the main chain, which is empty at this point, so we just add it.
            // ... 2. Insert 3 at position 2 in the main chain, which now contains [2], so we add it after 2.
            // ... 3. The final main chain will be [2, 3].
            // ... and the position 0? the position 0 is always reserved for the first element of the main chain, which is always 1. So we always start with 1 in the main chain, and then we insert minors after that.
            // ... and why we do this? We do this to ensure that the insertion order of minors is based on the Jacobsthal sequence, which allows us to insert them in a specific order that minimizes the number of comparisons and swaps needed to sort the main chain.
            
            while (jacobsthal[jacobsthal.size() - 1] < n) // jacobsthal[jacobsthal.size() - 1] is the last element of the Jacobsthal sequence, and we keep generating new elements until the last element is less than n.
            // ... jacobsthal[1] is 1, jacobsthal[2] is 1, jacobsthal[3] is 3, jacobsthal[4] is 5, jacobsthal[5] is 11, and so on.
            // ... So we keep generating new elements until the last element is less than n.
            // ... For example, if n = 10, we would generate the sequence [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11], and then we would stop because the last element (11) is greater than n (10).

7 - Implementation is in accordance with the subject and evaluation sheet for Module 09, Exercise 02 (PmergeMe). Here’s how you can evidence and explain this to your evaluator:
    7.1. Use of Two Different Containers
        - Where in the code:
            . You use both std::vector<int> and std::deque<int> throughout your implementation.
            . See the function signatures and usage:
                - void PmergeMe::sortVector(std::vector<int>& v)
                - void PmergeMe::sortDeque(std::deque<int>& d)
                - bool PmergeMe::parseInput(int argc, char** argv, std::vector<int>& v, std::deque<int>& d)
        - How to explain:
            . The subject requires two different containers to compare their performance.
            . std::vector is a dynamic array with fast random access and efficient memory usage.
            . std::deque is a double-ended queue, also with fast random access, but allows fast insertions/removals at both ends.
            . Both are suitable for the Ford-Johnson algorithm, which needs fast access and reasonable insertion performance.
            . You did not use containers from previous exercises (like std::list or std::set), which would be forbidden.
    7.2. Merge-Insert Sort (Ford-Johnson) Algorithm
        - Where in the code:
            . The core sorting logic is in:
                - void PmergeMe::sortVector(std::vector<int>& v)
                - void PmergeMe::sortDeque(std::deque<int>& d)
            . The algorithm:
                - Pairs elements, sorts each pair, separates majors/minors, recursively sorts majors, inserts minors using Jacobsthal-based order, and handles stragglers.
            . Helper functions:
                - generateJacobsthal(int n)
                - generateInsertionOrder(int n)
        - How to explain:
            . The Ford-Johnson (merge-insert) algorithm is implemented as required by the subject.
            . The code pairs elements, sorts majors recursively, and inserts minors in the optimal order using the Jacobsthal sequence.
            . Both containers have their own implementation (no generic function), as advised.
    7.3. Why These Containers?
        - How to explain:
            . std::vector and std::deque both provide O(1) random access, which is essential for pairing and insertion in the Ford-Johnson algorithm.
            . std::vector is cache-friendly and efficient for end insertions.
            . std::deque allows fast insertions/removals at both ends, which can be beneficial for certain operations.
            . Other containers (like std::list, std::set, or std::map) are not suitable because they lack fast random access or allow no duplicates.
    7.4. Evidence in Code for Evaluation
        - Two containers:
            . Shown in function signatures and in parseInput.
        - Algorithm present for each container:
            . sortVector and sortDeque are both implemented and used.
        - No forbidden containers:
            . Only vector and deque are used, not list, set, or containers from previous exercises.
        - No forbidden functions or C++11 features:
            . No printf, malloc, free, or C++11+ features.
        - No function implementations in headers (except templates):
            . All logic is in the .cpp file.
    7.5. How to Demonstrate During Evaluation
        . Show the code for sortVector and sortDeque and explain the algorithm steps.
        . Point out the use of both containers in parseInput and sorting functions.
        . Run the program with the required test command (e.g., jot -r 3000 1 1000 | tr '\n' ' ') and show the output, including timing for both containers.
        . Be ready to explain the time differences (due to memory layout, cache, and insertion characteristics).
    7.6. Summary Table for the Evaluator
        . I use two different STL containers (std::vector and std::deque), as required.
        . I implement the Ford-Johnson (merge-insert) sort algorithm for each container, with separate functions (sortVector, sortDeque).
        . I do not use containers from previous exercises (such as std::list or std::set), which would be forbidden.
        . My code is C++98 compliant, does not use forbidden functions, and does not implement logic in headers (except for templates).
        . The code is well-commented, and you can clearly explain the choice of containers and the algorithm to the evaluator.
        . The program is designed to handle at least 3000 integers and provides the required output and timing for both containers.
